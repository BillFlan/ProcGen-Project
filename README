.Controls:
WASD to fly around
Arrow keys to move camera
Q/E to change the number of octaves of noise
[/] to change the scale of noise
1/2 to decrease/increase persistence of noise
3/4 to decrease/increase lacunarity of noise
;/' keys to decrease/increase the slope of noise
-/+ keys to decrease/increase the vertical shift of the noise
k to toggle scrolling terrain
Spacebar to seed a new world

This project requires GLFW, GLM, and Stb_image. GLM and Stb_image are included and GLFW should link if you have it

To use the program, have fun playing with the parameters. I got lost making a bunch of combinations.
You could also just fly around the  world and enjoy watching the days pass by.

What I'm proud of:
I built this using the OpenGL core profile which has a very steep learning curve (you were right about that)
My terrain generates instantly because the terrain geneation is built in a vertex shader
I implimented per pixel Phong shading and my normals are generated on the fly per pixel as well in the fragment shader
Because of the normals being generated in this way, my water appears to have depth even though it is completley flat
The water has another set of normals generated in the fragment shader which add a wavey texture using turbulent noise and it animates to look like "real" waves (this is my favorite feature)
I figured out how to to use std140 uniform buffer objects, which although passing data is not that impressive graphically, it took me so long so I'm pretty proud of it.


I know in my original project proposal I discussed building plants and having them distributed throughout the world, but I just ran out of time. I know you said that terrain generation wasn't that hard, but this may have been the hardest project I have ever done in my entire life (I am still young though). I hope that my hard work is evident in my code.
